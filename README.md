# Exercism JavaSCript Track

My solutions to the exercises on the [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io) JavaScript track.

## Workflow

1. Download the exercise
    * `exercism download --exercise=<exercise name> --track=javascript`
2. Install dependencies
    * `npm install`
3. Solve the problem
4. Run tests
    * `npm test` (Enable tests by removing the 'x' prefix on each test)
    * Repeat 3-4 until all tests pass
5. Refactor code
    * Ensure tests still pass
6. Submit the solution
    * `exercism submit /path/to/file [/path/to/file2 ...]`
